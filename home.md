# Upgrade program
#### This repository is being used to develop the theme for the upgrade program.
- The upgrade program is primarily a plan for upgrading outdated sites quickly
- Each website will have different styling based on themes (corporate, services)
- A new website should aim to be completed in 3 days
- The different themes are intended to support the perceived use cases of clients.
- The idea of the theme is to be able to easily add new components and update features as needed in the future
