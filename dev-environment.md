### Development Environment
I've managed to set up a nice environment which requires minimal configuration for hosting local sites. I'm using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) & [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet).

> Valet is a Laravel development environment for Mac minimalists. No Vagrant, no /etc/hosts file. You can even share your sites publicly using local tunnels. Yeah, we like it too.

> Laravel Valet configures your Mac to always run Nginx in the background when your machine starts. Then, using DnsMasq, Valet proxies all requests on the *.test domain to point to sites installed on your local machine.

> Rather than running a virtual machine Ãƒ  la Docker, Valet runs Nginx in the background and uses your local PHP and MySQL. This keeps your development environment very lean, only using about 7MB of RAM.

> Out of the box, Valet support includes, but is not limited to:
> - [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
> - [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com)
> - [Symfony](https://symfony.com)
> - [Zend](https://framework.zend.com)
> - [CakePHP 3](https://cakephp.org)
> - [WordPress](https://wordpress.org)
> - [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/)
> - [Craft](https://craftcms.com)
> - [Statamic](https://statamic.com)
> - [Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.tighten.co)
> - Static HTML

I found several useful guides online: [here](https://dev.to/pixleight/local-craft-cms-development-with-laravel-valet-27f8), [here](https://medium.com/@jalendport/running-craft-cms-3-on-laravel-valet-6df61e5193fd) & [here](https://bymayo.co.uk/writing/installing-laravel-valet-for-craft-cms)

Once it's all set up next time I need to create a craft theme all I have to do is:
````bash
# Move to your parked projects directory
cd ~/Sites

# Create a new database
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE new_db_name"

# Install Craft
composer create-project craftcms/craft new-site-name

# Setup Craft, filling in database credentials
# with username root and no password
new-site-name/craft setup
````
``new-site-name`` will automatically be served at ``http://<new-site-name>.test``

Or if preferred, you can install ``phpmyadmin`` and mange the database using the GUI, [here's](https://thepoweruser.wordpress.com/2018/11/22/how-to-set-up-and-use-phpmyadmin-with-laravel-valet/) a guide

Valet will automatically start its daemon each time your machine boots. There is no need to run ``valet start`` or ``valet install`` ever again once the initial Valet installation is complete.

#### Sharing Sites
To share a site, navigate to the site's directory in your terminal and run the ``valet share`` command. A publicly accessible URL will be inserted into your clipboard and is ready to paste directly into your browser. That's it.

general.php - this hooks up the styles to the shared domain which is new each time like: ``  http://d37419f75d41.ngrok.io ``
```php
$isNgrok = array_key_exists("HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_HOST", $_SERVER) && strpos($_SERVER["HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_HOST"], "ngrok");
$host = 'http://' . $_SERVER[$isNgrok ? 'HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_HOST' : 'SERVER_NAME'] . '/';
```
